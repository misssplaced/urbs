Cities can be seen as systems of urban artefacts interacting with human activities. Since cities
in this sense need to be organized and coordinated, convergences and divergences between
the “planned” and the “lived” city have always been of paramount interest in urban planning.
The increasing amount of geo big data and the growing impact of Internet of Things (IoT) in
contemporary Smart City is pushing toward a conceptualization of urban systems as socio-technical, taking into
consideration the complexity of human behaviors. This work contributes to this view by proposing
an ontological analysis of urban artefacts and their roles, focusing in particular on the
difference between social roles and functional roles through the prism of social practices.
